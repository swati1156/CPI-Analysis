# CPI Analysis

## Overview
In India, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to measure inflation, and it involves a fixed basket of goods and services. This basket is comprehensive and includes a wide array of items that an average Indian consumer uses. These items are not limited to just food and clothing but extend to transportation, medical care, electricity, education, and almost every other category that involves expenditure of money. The CPI is calculated by comparing the general price level in the markets during a particular time period with a base year. The items in the CPI basket are classified across various categories like food and beverages, clothing, housing, fuel and light, and recreation, among others. The main objective is to understand the trends in CPI and deep dive into data to find insights.
